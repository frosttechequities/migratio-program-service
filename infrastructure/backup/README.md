# Backup and Disaster Recovery Strategy

This document outlines the backup and disaster recovery strategy for the Migratio platform.

## Overview

The Migratio platform implements a comprehensive backup and disaster recovery strategy to ensure data durability, business continuity, and minimal downtime in case of failures.

## Backup Strategy

### Database Backups

#### MongoDB

- **Full Backups**: Daily full backups of all databases
- **Incremental Backups**: Hourly incremental backups
- **Oplog Backups**: Continuous oplog backups for point-in-time recovery
- **Retention**: 30 days for daily backups, 7 days for hourly backups

Backup implementation:

```yaml
# Example MongoDB backup CronJob
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: mongodb-backup
  namespace: migratio-production
spec:
  schedule: "0 1 * * *"  # Daily at 1 AM
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: mongodb-backup
            image: migratio/mongodb-backup:latest
            env:
            - name: MONGODB_URI
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mongodb-backup-secrets
                  key: MONGODB_URI
            - name: BACKUP_BUCKET
              value: "migratio-backups"
            - name: BACKUP_PATH
              value: "mongodb/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
            - name: RETENTION_DAYS
              value: "30"
            volumeMounts:
            - name: backup-volume
              mountPath: /backup
          volumes:
          - name: backup-volume
            persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: mongodb-backup-pvc
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

#### Redis

- **RDB Snapshots**: Hourly RDB snapshots
- **AOF Persistence**: Enabled with fsync every second
- **Retention**: 7 days

### File Storage Backups

- **User Uploads**: Daily backups of user-uploaded files
- **Generated PDFs**: Daily backups of generated PDF documents
- **Retention**: 30 days

### Configuration Backups

- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Daily backups of all Kubernetes manifests
- **Environment Configurations**: Daily backups of all environment configurations
- **Secrets**: Daily backups of all secrets (encrypted)
- **Retention**: 90 days

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

- **Critical Services**: < 1 hour
- **Non-Critical Services**: < 4 hours

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

- **Database Data**: < 5 minutes
- **File Storage**: < 24 hours
- **Configuration**: < 24 hours

### Disaster Recovery Procedures

#### Database Recovery

1. **MongoDB Recovery**:
   - Restore the latest full backup
   - Apply incremental backups
   - Apply oplog to reach the desired point in time
   - Verify data integrity

2. **Redis Recovery**:
   - Restore the latest RDB snapshot
   - Apply AOF logs if available
   - Verify cache state

#### Infrastructure Recovery

1. **Kubernetes Cluster Recovery**:
   - Provision new Kubernetes cluster
   - Apply backed up Kubernetes manifests
   - Restore secrets
   - Verify cluster health

2. **Service Recovery**:
   - Deploy services in order of dependencies
   - Verify service health and connectivity
   - Run integration tests

#### Data Verification

After recovery, the following verification steps are performed:

1. Run data integrity checks
2. Verify service-to-service communication
3. Run end-to-end tests
4. Perform manual verification of critical functionality

## Multi-Region Strategy

The Migratio platform implements a multi-region strategy for high availability:

### Primary Region

- All services deployed and active
- Primary database instances
- Primary file storage

### Secondary Region

- Core services deployed but inactive
- Database replicas in sync with primary
- File storage replicas in sync with primary

### Failover Process

In case of a primary region failure:

1. Promote database replicas in secondary region to primary
2. Update DNS records to point to secondary region
3. Activate services in secondary region
4. Verify functionality in secondary region

## Testing and Validation

The backup and recovery procedures are tested regularly:

- **Monthly**: Test database recovery procedures
- **Quarterly**: Full disaster recovery drill
- **Bi-annually**: Multi-region failover test

## Monitoring and Alerting

The backup and recovery processes are monitored:

- Backup job success/failure alerts
- Backup size anomaly detection
- Recovery time monitoring
- Data integrity check results

## Documentation and Training

- Detailed recovery runbooks for each component
- Regular training for operations team
- Post-incident reviews and procedure improvements

## Compliance and Auditing

- Backup encryption for data at rest
- Access controls for backup storage
- Audit logs for all backup and recovery operations
- Regular compliance reviews

## Continuous Improvement

The backup and disaster recovery strategy is reviewed and improved:

- After each incident or drill
- When new services are added
- When compliance requirements change
- Quarterly review of RTO and RPO targets
