# Migratio Recommendation Algorithm Specification

## Overview

The recommendation algorithm is the core intelligence of Migratio, matching user profiles with optimal immigration pathways. This document outlines the technical approach, scoring methodology, and implementation strategy for this critical system component.

## Algorithm Objectives

The recommendation system must:

1. **Accurately Match**: Identify immigration programs that align with user qualifications and preferences
2. **Prioritize Effectively**: Rank recommendations based on likelihood of success and user priorities
3. **Explain Reasoning**: Provide transparent justification for recommendations
4. **Adapt Dynamically**: Adjust to changing immigration policies and user inputs
5. **Avoid Bias**: Ensure fair treatment across demographic groups

## System Architecture

The recommendation algorithm consists of several interconnected components that work together to generate personalized immigration pathway recommendations:

### 1. User Profile Processor

Transforms raw user data into a structured profile suitable for matching:

- Normalizes education credentials across different systems
- Standardizes work experience using occupation classification codes
- Calculates derived attributes (e.g., total years of experience, language proficiency scores)
- Identifies key qualifications and strengths
- Determines user preferences and priorities

### 2. Eligibility Analyzer

Evaluates user profiles against program requirements:

- Performs initial filtering to eliminate clearly unsuitable programs
- Checks mandatory requirements (e.g., age limits, education minimums)
- Evaluates complex eligibility rules with conditional logic
- Identifies partial matches where some but not all criteria are met
- Flags potential exemptions or special cases

### 3. Scoring Engine

Calculates match scores between user profiles and immigration programs:

- Assigns weighted scores to different criteria based on importance
- Applies scoring functions appropriate to each criterion type
- Calculates composite scores across multiple dimensions
- Normalizes scores for consistent comparison
- Incorporates confidence factors for uncertain data

### 4. Gap Analyzer

Identifies discrepancies between user qualifications and program requirements:

- Quantifies gaps in key areas (education, experience, language, finances)
- Estimates difficulty and timeframe to address each gap
- Suggests specific actions to improve eligibility
- Identifies alternative pathways with fewer or different gaps
- Calculates potential score improvements from addressing gaps

### 5. Ranking System

Orders recommendations based on multiple factors:

- Combines match scores with user preferences
- Applies weighting based on user priorities
- Considers processing times and success rates
- Incorporates cost factors if relevant to user
- Ensures diversity in top recommendations

### 6. Explanation Generator

Creates human-readable justifications for recommendations:

- Highlights key matching factors that led to recommendation
- Explains scoring and ranking decisions
- Identifies strengths and weaknesses in the application
- Provides context for why certain programs ranked higher than others
- Generates personalized advice based on profile analysis

## Matching Methodology

### Data Inputs

1. **User Profile Data**
   - Demographic information (age, nationality, family status)
   - Educational qualifications (degrees, institutions, fields of study)
   - Work experience (job titles, durations, responsibilities)
   - Language proficiency (test scores, self-assessments)
   - Financial resources (savings, income, investments)
   - Immigration history (previous applications, travel history)
   - Preferences (destination countries, timeline, priorities)

2. **Immigration Program Data**
   - Eligibility criteria (mandatory and optional requirements)
   - Point-based assessment grids where applicable
   - Processing times and success rates
   - Application costs and fees
   - Pathway characteristics (permanence, processing time, complexity)
   - Program availability and quotas
   - Recent policy changes and trends

### Scoring Framework

The algorithm employs a multi-dimensional scoring system:

#### 1. Criterion-Level Scoring

Each criterion is scored using an appropriate function:

```javascript
// Example scoring functions
const scoringFunctions = {
  // Binary criteria (yes/no)
  binary: (userValue, requirementValue) => {
    return userValue === requirementValue ? 1.0 : 0.0;
  },

  // Range criteria (e.g., age)
  range: (userValue, minValue, maxValue, optimalValue) => {
    if (userValue < minValue || userValue > maxValue) return 0.0;
    if (optimalValue && userValue === optimalValue) return 1.0;

    // Normalize within range
    const rangeSize = maxValue - minValue;
    const distanceFromOptimal = Math.abs(userValue - (optimalValue || (minValue + rangeSize/2)));
    const normalizedDistance = distanceFromOptimal / (rangeSize/2);
    return Math.max(0, 1 - normalizedDistance);
  },

  // Threshold criteria (minimum requirements)
  threshold: (userValue, thresholdValue) => {
    if (userValue >= thresholdValue) {
      // Bonus for exceeding threshold
      const excessRatio = Math.min(1, (userValue - thresholdValue) / thresholdValue);
      return 1.0 + (excessRatio * 0.5); // Up to 50% bonus
    }
    // Partial credit for approaching threshold
    return Math.max(0, userValue / thresholdValue);
  },

  // Points-based criteria
  points: (userAttributes, pointsTable) => {
    let totalPoints = 0;
    let maximumPoints = 0;

    for (const [attribute, value] of Object.entries(userAttributes)) {
      if (pointsTable[attribute]) {
        const pointsForAttribute = calculatePointsForAttribute(value, pointsTable[attribute]);
        totalPoints += pointsForAttribute.earned;
        maximumPoints += pointsForAttribute.maximum;
      }
    }

    return maximumPoints > 0 ? totalPoints / maximumPoints : 0;
  }
};
```

#### 2. Composite Scoring

Combines individual criterion scores into a comprehensive match score:

```javascript
function calculateCompositeScore(criterionScores, weights) {
  let weightedSum = 0;
  let totalWeight = 0;

  for (const [criterion, score] of Object.entries(criterionScores)) {
    const weight = weights[criterion] || 1;
    weightedSum += score * weight;
    totalWeight += weight;
  }

  return totalWeight > 0 ? weightedSum / totalWeight : 0;
}
```

#### 3. Preference Adjustment

Adjusts scores based on user preferences:

```javascript
function applyPreferenceAdjustments(baseScore, program, userPreferences) {
  let adjustedScore = baseScore;

  // Country preference adjustment
  if (userPreferences.countries.includes(program.country)) {
    adjustedScore *= 1.2; // 20% boost for preferred countries
  }

  // Timeline preference adjustment
  const timelineMatch = calculateTimelineCompatibility(
    program.processingTime,
    userPreferences.timeline
  );
  adjustedScore *= (0.8 + (timelineMatch * 0.4)); // Up to 20% adjustment

  // Cost preference adjustment
  const costFactor = calculateCostCompatibility(
    program.estimatedCost,
    userPreferences.budgetRange
  );
  adjustedScore *= (0.8 + (costFactor * 0.4)); // Up to 20% adjustment

  // Additional preference adjustments...

  return adjustedScore;
}
```

### Ranking Algorithm

The final ranking incorporates multiple factors beyond the base match score:

```javascript
function rankPrograms(scoredPrograms, userProfile) {
  // Apply additional ranking factors
  const rankedPrograms = scoredPrograms.map(program => {
    const baseRankingScore = program.matchScore;

    // Success probability factor
    const successProbability = calculateSuccessProbability(program, userProfile);

    // Processing time factor (faster is better, if that's a user priority)
    const timelineFactor = userProfile.preferences.prioritizeSpeed ?
      calculateTimelineFactor(program.processingTime) : 1;

    // Cost factor (lower cost is better, if that's a user priority)
    const costFactor = userProfile.preferences.prioritizeCost ?
      calculateCostFactor(program.estimatedCost) : 1;

    // Permanence factor (pathway to permanent residence/citizenship)
    const permanenceFactor = userProfile.preferences.prioritizePermanence ?
      calculatePermanenceFactor(program.pathwayToPermanence) : 1;

    // Calculate final ranking score
    const rankingScore = baseRankingScore *
      successProbability *
      timelineFactor *
      costFactor *
      permanenceFactor;

    return {
      ...program,
      rankingScore,
      successProbability
    };
  });

  // Sort by ranking score
  return rankedPrograms.sort((a, b) => b.rankingScore - a.rankingScore);
}
```

## Gap Analysis Methodology

The gap analysis identifies areas where the user doesn't meet program requirements and provides actionable recommendations:

```javascript
function performGapAnalysis(userProfile, program) {
  const gaps = [];

  // Analyze each criterion
  for (const criterion of program.eligibilityCriteria) {
    const userValue = extractUserValue(userProfile, criterion.criterionType);
    const requirementValue = criterion.value;

    // Check if there's a gap
    if (!meetsCriterion(userValue, requirementValue, criterion.comparisonType)) {
      // Calculate gap size
      const gapSize = calculateGapSize(userValue, requirementValue, criterion.comparisonType);

      // Determine difficulty to address
      const difficulty = assessDifficulty(criterion.criterionType, gapSize);

      // Estimate time required
      const timeRequired = estimateTimeToAddress(criterion.criterionType, gapSize);

      // Generate improvement suggestions
      const suggestions = generateSuggestions(criterion, gapSize, userProfile);

      gaps.push({
        criterionType: criterion.criterionType,
        criterionName: criterion.name,
        currentValue: userValue,
        requiredValue: requirementValue,
        gapSize,
        difficulty,
        timeRequired,
        suggestions
      });
    }
  }

  return {
    hasGaps: gaps.length > 0,
    gaps,
    overallDifficulty: calculateOverallDifficulty(gaps),
    estimatedTimeToEligibility: estimateOverallTime(gaps)
  };
}
```

## Explanation Generation

The explanation generator creates transparent, understandable justifications for recommendations:

```javascript
function generateExplanation(matchResult, userProfile, program) {
  const explanation = {
    overallMatch: {
      score: matchResult.matchScore,
      summary: generateMatchSummary(matchResult.matchScore)
    },
    strengths: [],
    challenges: [],
    keyFactors: [],
    comparisonPoints: []
  };

  // Identify top strengths
  const strengths = matchResult.criterionScores
    .filter(cs => cs.score > 0.8)
    .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)
    .slice(0, 3);

  explanation.strengths = strengths.map(strength => ({
    factor: strength.criterionName,
    description: generateStrengthDescription(strength, userProfile, program)
  }));

  // Identify key challenges
  const challenges = matchResult.criterionScores
    .filter(cs => cs.score < 0.5 && cs.weight > 0.5)
    .sort((a, b) => a.score - b.score)
    .slice(0, 3);

  explanation.challenges = challenges.map(challenge => ({
    factor: challenge.criterionName,
    description: generateChallengeDescription(challenge, userProfile, program),
    suggestion: generateImprovementSuggestion(challenge, userProfile)
  }));

  // Identify key deciding factors
  explanation.keyFactors = identifyKeyDecidingFactors(matchResult, userProfile, program);

  // Generate comparison points with other programs
  explanation.comparisonPoints = generateComparisonPoints(program, matchResult.otherPrograms);

  return explanation;
}
```
