# Website Q&A RAG Chatbot Guide Summary

This folder contains a comprehensive guide and implementation for building a Website Q&A RAG Chatbot. The content has been adapted from the Replit guide to work with Augment Code and Gemini API instead of Replit and OpenAI.

## Folder Structure

- `README.md` - Overview of the guide
- `SUMMARY.md` - This summary file
- `code/` - Original code samples from the Replit guide
- `implementation/` - Adapted implementation for Augment Code and Gemini API
- `images/` - Screenshots and diagrams from the guide

## Key Components

### 1. Vector Database

The implementation uses Supabase with pgvector extension to store vector embeddings of website content. This allows for efficient similarity search when answering questions.

### 2. LangChain Framework

LangChain is used to:
- Parse website content
- Convert content to embeddings
- Create retrieval chains for answering questions

### 3. Gemini API

Google's Gemini API is used for:
- Generating embeddings of website content
- Answering questions based on retrieved content

### 4. Web Scraping

The implementation uses:
- sitemap.xml to discover website pages
- CheerioWebBaseLoader to extract content from pages
- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to break content into manageable chunks

### 5. Express Server

A simple Express server provides:
- API endpoints for scraping websites and asking questions
- Static file serving for the frontend interface

### 6. Frontend Interface

A clean, responsive frontend allows users to:
- Enter a website URL to train the chatbot
- Ask questions about the website content
- View answers in a chat-like interface

## Implementation Details

### Free Tier Considerations

The implementation is designed to work within free tier limits:
- Limits the number of URLs processed (configurable via MAX_URLS)
- Uses Supabase's free tier for vector storage
- Leverages Gemini API's free tier for embeddings and completions

### Adaptations from Original Guide

- Replaced OpenAI with Gemini API
- Replaced Neon PostgreSQL with Supabase
- Added rate limiting and URL processing limits
- Enhanced frontend with loading indicators and better error handling
- Added detailed setup instructions

## Getting Started

To get started with this implementation:

1. Follow the setup instructions in `implementation/SETUP.md`
2. Configure your environment variables
3. Install dependencies and run the application

## Use Cases for Visafy

This chatbot can be particularly useful for Visafy by:

1. Answering questions about immigration programs and requirements
2. Providing information about document preparation
3. Explaining application procedures
4. Clarifying eligibility criteria
5. Offering guidance on timelines and deadlines

By integrating this chatbot into the Visafy platform, users can get immediate answers to their immigration questions without having to navigate through multiple pages of content.
