# Visafy Research Methodology and Standards

## Research Philosophy
The Visafy platform is built on a foundation of accurate, current, and practical immigration information. Our research methodology prioritizes:

1. **Real-world applicability**: Information that directly helps users navigate immigration processes
2. **Recency**: Current (2023-2025) data that reflects the latest policies and procedures
3. **Comprehensiveness**: Covering all aspects of immigration across multiple pathways
4. **Accuracy**: Verified information from authoritative sources
5. **Clarity**: Complex immigration concepts explained in accessible language

## Research Standards

### Source Hierarchy
All Visafy research adheres to a strict hierarchy of sources:

1. **Primary Government Sources**
   - Official immigration department websites
   - Government publications and bulletins
   - Official statistical releases
   - Published legislation and regulations

2. **Secondary Authoritative Sources**

   - Must be from 2023-2025
   - Verified against latest policy announcements
   - Scheduled for semi-annual review

3. **Historical Context**: Policy trends, success rates
   - Can include older data (2020-2022) for context
   - Must be clearly labeled as historical
   - Should include notes on current relevance
