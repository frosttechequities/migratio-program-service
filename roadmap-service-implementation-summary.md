# Roadmap Service Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the Roadmap Service for the Visafy platform.

## Overview

The Roadmap Service is a microservice that manages the generation and management of personalized immigration roadmaps for users based on their assessment results and program recommendations. It follows the same architecture pattern as the Program Service, which has been successfully deployed to Render.

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend (Roadmap Service)

1. **Authentication Middleware**
   - `services/roadmap-service/middleware/authMiddleware.js` - Implements JWT token verification for protecting routes

2. **Controller Updates**
   - `services/roadmap-service/controllers/roadmapController.js` - Implemented missing methods:
     - `updateRoadmap` - For updating roadmap details, task status, etc.
     - `deleteRoadmap` - For deleting roadmaps

3. **Route Updates**
   - `services/roadmap-service/routes/roadmapRoutes.js` - Updated to use authentication middleware

4. **Deployment Configuration**
   - `services/roadmap-service/render.yaml` - Added for easy deployment to Render
   - `services/roadmap-service/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Detailed deployment instructions
   - `services/roadmap-service/DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md` - Step-by-step deployment guide

5. **Package Updates**
   - `services/roadmap-service/package.json` - Added jsonwebtoken dependency

6. **Environment Configuration**
   - `services/roadmap-service/.env.example` - Updated with JWT_SECRET and other required variables

7. **Documentation**
   - `services/roadmap-service/README.md` - Added comprehensive documentation

### Frontend Integration

1. **Service Integration**
   - `src/frontend/src/features/roadmap/roadmapService.js` - Updated to use the deployed Roadmap Service API
   - Implemented the `generateRoadmap` function for creating roadmaps

## Next Steps

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Create a new repository: `migratio-roadmap-service`
   - Push the roadmap service code to this repository

2. **Deploy to Render**
   - Set up the Roadmap Service for deployment on Render
   - Configure environment variables
   - Deploy the service

3. **Test the Deployment**
   - Test API endpoints
   - Verify database connection
   - Check authentication

4. **Frontend Integration**
   - Test the integration between the frontend and the deployed Roadmap Service
   - Verify roadmap creation, viewing, and updating functionality

## Architecture

The Roadmap Service follows a microservice architecture pattern:

1. **API Layer** - Express.js routes and controllers
2. **Authentication** - JWT-based authentication
3. **Database** - MongoDB for storing roadmap data
4. **Service Integration** - Communication with other services (Program Service, User Service)

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/roadmaps` - Create a new roadmap
- `GET /api/roadmaps` - Get all roadmaps for the authenticated user
- `GET /api/roadmaps/:id` - Get a specific roadmap by ID
- `PATCH /api/roadmaps/:id` - Update a roadmap's details
- `DELETE /api/roadmaps/:id` - Delete a roadmap
- `PATCH /api/roadmaps/:roadmapId/phases/:phaseId/tasks/:taskId` - Update a task's status
- `PATCH /api/roadmaps/:roadmapId/phases/:phaseId/documents/:docStatusId` - Update a document's status

## Deployment

The Roadmap Service is designed to be deployed to Render, following the same pattern as the Program Service. The deployment process is documented in the `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` and `DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md` files.

## Integration with Other Services

The Roadmap Service integrates with:

1. **Program Service** - To get program details for roadmap generation
2. **User Service** - For authentication and user information
3. **Document Service** - For document requirements and status tracking (future integration)

## Conclusion

The Roadmap Service implementation provides a solid foundation for the Roadmap Generation system in the Visafy platform. By following the deployment steps, you can easily deploy the service to Render and integrate it with the frontend.
