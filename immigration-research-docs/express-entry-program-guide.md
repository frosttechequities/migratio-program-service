# Express Entry Program Guide

## Overview

The Express Entry system is Canada's flagship immigration management system for key economic immigration programs. Launched in January 2015, Express Entry is not an immigration program itself but rather a system used to manage applications for permanent residence under three federal economic immigration programs:

1. Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)
2. Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP)
3. Canadian Experience Class (CEC)

Additionally, provinces and territories can recruit candidates from the Express Entry pool through their Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) to meet local labor market needs.

## How Express Entry Works

The Express Entry system operates on a points-based ranking system called the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). Here's how the process works:

1. **Create an online profile**: Candidates submit an online profile with information about their skills, work experience, language abilities, education, and other details.

2. **Enter the pool**: Eligible candidates are placed in the Express Entry pool and ranked using the CRS.

3. **Receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA)**: The highest-ranking candidates are invited to apply for permanent residence through regular draws.

4. **Submit a complete application**: Invited candidates have 60 days to submit a complete application for permanent residence.

5. **Application processing**: IRCC processes complete applications within 6 months in 80% of cases.

## Eligibility Requirements
