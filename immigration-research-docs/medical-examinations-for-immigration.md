# Medical Examinations for Immigration

## Introduction

Medical examinations are a mandatory component of most immigration processes worldwide. These examinations serve to ensure that applicants do not pose a public health risk to the destination country and that they will not place excessive demands on health and social services. This comprehensive guide covers the requirements, procedures, and considerations for immigration medical examinations across major destination countries.
