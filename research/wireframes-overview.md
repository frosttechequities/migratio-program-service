# Migratio Wireframes and User Flows Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the wireframing approach and user flows for the Migratio platform. Due to the complexity of the application, wireframes and user flows are organized into separate documents by functional area.

## Wireframing Approach

The wireframes for Migratio follow these principles:

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is presented gradually to avoid overwhelming users
2. **Responsive Design**: All screens are designed with mobile and desktop views
3. **Accessibility**: Interfaces follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
4. **Consistency**: UI patterns are consistent across the application
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Important elements receive visual emphasis
6. **Feedback**: System status and user actions are clearly communicated

## Fidelity Level

The initial wireframes are medium-fidelity, providing:
- Layout and structure
- Navigation elements
- Content organization
- Key interactions
- Basic visual hierarchy

These wireframes will be refined through user testing before moving to high-fidelity designs.

## User Flow Documentation

User flows are documented using:
- Flow diagrams showing screen sequences
- Decision points and conditional paths
- Error states and recovery paths
- Success paths and completion states

## Wireframe and User Flow Documents

The wireframes and user flows are organized into the following documents:

1. **[User Registration and Onboarding](wireframes/user-registration-flows.md)**
   - Account creation
   - Profile setup
   - Initial assessment

2. **[Assessment Quiz](wireframes/assessment-quiz-flows.md)**
   - Question types
   - Quiz navigation
   - Progress tracking
   - Results presentation

3. **[Recommendation Engine](wireframes/recommendation-flows.md)**
   - Recommendation display
   - Program comparison
   - Gap analysis
   - Explanation views

4. **[Immigration Roadmap](wireframes/roadmap-flows.md)**
   - Roadmap visualization
   - Timeline view
   - Document checklist
   - Progress tracking

5. **[User Dashboard](wireframes/dashboard-flows.md)**
   - Overview layout
   - Navigation structure
   - Notification system
   - Quick actions

6. **[PDF Generation](wireframes/pdf-generation-flows.md)**
   - Customization options
   - Preview functionality
   - Download process
   - Sharing capabilities

7. **[Subscription Management](wireframes/subscription-flows.md)**
   - Plan comparison
   - Payment process
   - Account management
   - Upgrade/downgrade flows

## Design System Elements

Common elements across wireframes include:

1. **Navigation Components**
   - Primary navigation
   - Secondary navigation
   - Breadcrumbs
   - Progress indicators

2. **Input Controls**
   - Text fields
   - Selection controls
   - Date pickers
   - Sliders and range inputs

3. **Information Components**
   - Cards
   - Lists
   - Tables
   - Charts and visualizations

4. **Feedback Components**
   - Notifications
   - Progress indicators
   - Success/error messages
   - Loading states

5. **Modal Components**
   - Dialogs
   - Popovers
   - Tooltips
   - Drawers

## Responsive Breakpoints

Wireframes consider these key breakpoints:
- Mobile: 320px - 480px
- Tablet: 481px - 768px
- Desktop: 769px - 1200px
- Large Desktop: 1201px and above

## User Testing Plan

These wireframes will be validated through:
1. Stakeholder reviews
2. Usability testing with representative users
3. A/B testing of alternative approaches for key flows
4. Accessibility evaluation

## Next Steps

1. Review wireframes with stakeholders
2. Conduct initial usability testing
3. Refine based on feedback
4. Develop interactive prototypes
5. Proceed to visual design

## Tools Used

- Figma for wireframe creation
- Lucidchart for user flow diagrams
- InVision for interactive prototypes (future phase)
