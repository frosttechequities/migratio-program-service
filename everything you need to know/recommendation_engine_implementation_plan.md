# Recommendation Engine Improvements Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the Recommendation Engine in the Migratio platform. The improvements focus on two main areas:

1. **Success Probability Model**: Implementing a machine learning model to predict application success probability and displaying this information to users.
2. **Basic Gap Analysis**: Identifying qualification gaps and providing actionable recommendations to improve eligibility.

## Current Status

The recommendation engine currently provides basic matching between user profiles and immigration programs based on eligibility criteria. It calculates match scores but lacks advanced features like success probability prediction and gap analysis.
