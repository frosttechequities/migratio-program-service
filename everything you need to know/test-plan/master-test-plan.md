# Master Test Plan

This document provides an overview of the testing strategy for the Migratio platform. It outlines how to break down tests into smaller, more manageable chunks to facilitate easier debugging and issue resolution.

## Test Plan Structure

The test plan is divided into several feature-specific plans:

1. [Dashboard Test Plan](./dashboard-test-plan.md)
2. [Recommendations Test Plan](./recommendations-test-plan.md)
3. [Document Management Test Plan](./document-management-test-plan.md)
4. [Roadmap Test Plan](./roadmap-test-plan.md)

Each feature-specific plan contains detailed test cases and commands for testing individual components and their integration.

## Testing Principles

1. **Test in Isolation**: Test components in isolation before testing their integration
2. **Small Test Chunks**: Break down tests into small, focused chunks
3. **Progressive Testing**: Start with simple rendering tests, then move to more complex scenarios
4. **Error Handling**: Explicitly test error handling and edge cases
5. **Data Variations**: Test with different data scenarios (empty, valid, malformed)

## Common Test Categories

Across all feature areas, we test the following aspects:

1. **Component Rendering**: Does the component render correctly with different props?
2. **Data Handling**: How does the component handle different data scenarios?
3. **Redux Integration**: Does the component interact correctly with the Redux store?
4. **User Interaction**: Does the component respond correctly to user interactions?
5. **Error Handling**: Does the component handle errors gracefully?

## Test Command Patterns

Use these command patterns to run specific types of tests:

```bash
# Run a specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test/file.test.js

# Run tests matching a specific pattern
npm test -- --testNamePattern="pattern to match"

# Run a specific test within a file
npm test -- --testNamePattern="Component renders correctly" path/to/test/file.test.js

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage --collectCoverageFrom="src/features/feature-name/**/*.js"
```

## Test Execution Strategy

Follow this strategy to systematically identify and fix issues:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with the smallest, most focused tests
2. **Fix Issues Immediately**: Fix issues as they are discovered before moving on
3. **Verify Fixes**: Re-run tests to verify that fixes work
4. **Expand Scope**: Gradually expand to more complex tests
5. **Integration Testing**: Finally, test the integration of components

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Component Rendering Issues

**Symptoms**:
- Component fails to render
- Component renders incorrectly
- Missing elements in the rendered output

**Potential Solutions**:
- Check for missing or incorrect props
- Ensure conditional rendering logic is correct
- Verify that required dependencies are available

### 2. Data Handling Issues

**Symptoms**:
- Component crashes with certain data
- Component displays incorrect data
- Empty states not handled properly

**Potential Solutions**:
- Add null/undefined checks
- Use default values for missing properties
- Add proper empty state handling

### 3. Redux Integration Issues

**Symptoms**:
- Component doesn't update when state changes
- Actions don't update state correctly
- Selectors return incorrect data

**Potential Solutions**:
- Verify that selectors handle all state scenarios
- Ensure reducers correctly update state
- Check that components are connected to the store correctly

### 4. Error Handling Issues

**Symptoms**:
- Component crashes on error
- Error messages not displayed
- Error states not handled properly

**Potential Solutions**:
- Add try/catch blocks
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Add fallback UI for error states

## Test Reporting

After running tests, analyze the output to identify issues:

1. **Failed Tests**: Look for tests that fail and understand why
2. **Console Errors**: Check for console errors in the test output
3. **Coverage Gaps**: Identify areas with low test coverage

## Next Steps

1. Start with the Dashboard Test Plan
2. Run the smallest, most focused tests first
3. Fix issues as they are discovered
4. Document fixed issues and their solutions
5. Move on to the next test plan

By following this structured approach, we can systematically identify and fix issues in the application.
