   - ✅ Quality issues list
   - ✅ Improvement suggestions

5. **Extracted Data Review**
   - ✅ Display of extracted data
   - ✅ Editing capabilities
   - ✅ Validation of edited data

6. **Document Completeness**
   - ✅ Completeness score display
   - ✅ Missing information indicators
   - ✅ Required fields highlighting

## Database Schema

The document management features use the following Supabase table structure:

### user_documents

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | integer | Primary key |
| user_id | uuid | Foreign key to auth.users |
| name | varchar | Document name |
| file_path | varchar | Path to file in storage |
| file_url | varchar | Public URL for the file |
| file_type | varchar | MIME type |
| document_type | varchar | Type of document (passport, certificate, etc.) |
| status | varchar | Processing status |
| upload_date | timestamp | Upload timestamp |
| verified_at | timestamp | Verification timestamp |
| expires_at | timestamp | Expiration date |

## Integration Points

1. **Supabase Storage Integration**
   - Documents are stored in the 'documents' bucket in Supabase storage
   - File paths are structured as 'documents/{user_id}/{filename}'
   - Public URLs are generated for file access

2. **Supabase Database Integration**
   - Document metadata is stored in the 'user_documents' table
   - User authentication is handled through Supabase Auth

3. **OCR Processing Integration**
   - OCR processing is simulated in the frontend for now
   - Status updates are tracked in the 'user_documents' table

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **OCR Processing**
   - Currently, OCR processing is simulated in the frontend
   - Real OCR processing with Tesseract or Azure AI will be implemented in a future update

2. **Document Types**
   - Limited document types are supported
   - Custom document types will be added in a future update

3. **Data Extraction**
   - Data extraction is currently limited to basic fields
   - Advanced data extraction for specific document types will be implemented in a future update

4. **Performance**
   - Large documents may cause performance issues
   - Optimization for large documents will be addressed in a future update

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real OCR Processing**
   - Implement real OCR processing with Tesseract or Azure AI
   - Add support for multiple languages
   - Improve OCR accuracy with pre-processing

2. **Advanced Data Extraction**
   - Implement document type-specific data extraction
   - Add support for complex document structures
   - Improve extraction accuracy with machine learning

3. **Document Verification**
   - Add document verification workflows
   - Implement verification status tracking
   - Add support for third-party verification services

4. **Document Sharing**
   - Add document sharing capabilities
   - Implement access control for shared documents
   - Add support for document collaboration

## Conclusion

The Document Management implementation has been successfully completed and integrated with the Migratio platform. The implementation provides a solid foundation for document management, with room for future enhancements to improve functionality and user experience.
