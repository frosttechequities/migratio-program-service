# Comprehensive Dashboard Experience Testing Prompts

This document contains a structured approach to thoroughly test the dashboard experience optimization with real components, covering all possible user interactions, edge cases, and real-world scenarios. The testing is broken down into manageable chunks to make the process more efficient and focused.

## Part 1: Dashboard Core Functionality Testing (IN PROGRESS)

```
Please help me create and run comprehensive tests for the dashboard core functionality using real components (no mocks). Focus on:

1. Dashboard loading and initialization
   - Test initial state loading
   - Test data fetching on mount
   - Test error handling during initialization
   - Test performance with different network conditions

2. Layout and responsiveness
   - Test default layout rendering
   - Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
   - Test widget positioning and grid system
   - Test layout persistence between sessions

3. Widget visibility and customization
   - Test showing/hiding individual widgets
   - Test drag-and-drop widget rearrangement
   - Test widget resizing
   - Test saving and loading custom layouts

Please use real components and actual Redux store implementation. Include tests for edge cases like empty data states, loading states, and error states.
```

### Progress Update (2023-12-15)

We've started implementing comprehensive tests for the dashboard core functionality using real components. The implementation includes:

1. **Test Environment Setup**
   - Created a test file `src/frontend/src/pages/dashboard/__tests__/DashboardComprehensive.test.js`
   - Set up a real Redux store with all necessary reducers (dashboard, profile, auth, ui, personalization, resources, recommendations)
   - Configured proper initial state for all reducers to simulate a realistic environment

2. **Dashboard Loading and Initialization Tests**
   - Implemented tests for initial state loading
   - Added tests for loading state display
   - Created tests for error state handling

3. **Layout and Responsiveness Tests**
   - Added tests for default layout rendering
   - Implemented tests for responsive behavior across different screen sizes
   - Created tests for layout persistence between sessions

4. **Widget Visibility and Customization Tests**
   - Implemented tests for showing/hiding widgets based on preferences
   - Added tests for toggling widget visibility through UI
   - Created tests for saving and loading custom layouts
   - Added tests for empty data states

5. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Implemented tests for network errors
   - Added tests for partial data loading failures

**Challenges Encountered:**
- The tests are encountering issues with infinite re-rendering loops due to non-memoized selectors in the actual components
- There are warnings about selectors returning the entire state, which can lead to unnecessary re-renders
- Authentication issues with Supabase in the test environment

**Next Steps:**
- Optimize the selectors in the actual components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement proper memoization for selectors that return new references
- Add more specific tests for widget interactions and customization
