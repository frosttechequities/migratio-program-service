## Key Patterns Across Point Systems

### Age Preferences:
Most systems strongly favor applicants between 25-35 years old. Points decrease significantly after age 40-45.

### Education Weighting:
Higher education is heavily valued, with most systems awarding maximum points for doctoral degrees and progressively fewer points for lower qualifications.

### Language Importance:
Official language proficiency is mandatory in most systems. The Canadian system places the highest relative value on language skills (up to 160 points out of 1,200).

### Local Experience Premium:
All systems award bonus points for work experience within the destination country, typically valuing it at 1.5-2 times foreign experience.

### Skill Shortages:
Most systems include mechanisms to award additional points for qualifications or experience in areas of national shortage.

### Spouse/Partner Factors:
Several systems (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong) award points for spouse/partner qualifications, recognizing the value of family units with multiple skilled individuals.

### Salary Thresholds:
The UK system is the most salary-focused, with specific thresholds for eligibility, while other systems typically incorporate salary as one factor among many.
