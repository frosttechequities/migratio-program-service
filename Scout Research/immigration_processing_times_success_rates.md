## CONCLUSION

Processing times and success rates vary significantly across immigration programs and countries. The most efficient systems generally feature:

1. **Digital-first application processes**
2. **Clear documentation requirements**
3. **Transparent points systems or eligibility criteria**
4. **Regular communication about application status**

4. **Allowing sufficient time for processing, including buffer for potential delays**

Immigration systems are becoming increasingly selective and sophisticated in their approach, with a growing emphasis on economic contribution, talent attraction, and integration potential rather than simply meeting minimum thresholds.
