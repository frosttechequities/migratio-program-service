# Immigration Data Standardization Guide for Visafy Platform

Integrating immigration data from multiple countries and sources presents significant standardization challenges. This guide outlines a comprehensive approach to data transformation, normalization, and integration to ensure consistent and reliable information across the Visafy platform.

## Common Data Challenges in Immigration Systems

### Terminology Variations

Different countries and systems use varying terminology for similar concepts:

| Concept | United States | Canada | Australia | United Kingdom | European Union |
|---------|--------------|--------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Work Authorization | Employment Authorization Document (EAD) | Work Permit | Work Visa | Work Permit | EU Blue Card / Work Permit |
| Permanent Residency | Lawful Permanent Resident / Green Card | Permanent Resident | Permanent Resident | Indefinite Leave to Remain | Long-term Residence Permit |
| Temporary Stay | Nonimmigrant Visa | Temporary Resident Visa | Temporary Visa | Limited Leave to Remain | Temporary Residence Permit |
| Family Sponsorship | Family Preference / Immediate Relative | Family Class | Family Stream | Family Visa | Family Reunification |
| Skills-Based Immigration | Employment-Based Preference | Express Entry | SkillSelect | Points-Based System | EU Blue Card |

### Data Format Inconsistencies

* **Dates**: MM/DD/YYYY (US) vs. DD/MM/YYYY (UK, Australia) vs. YYYY-MM-DD (Canada, ISO standard)
* **Names**: Different ordering and handling of first/middle/last names
* **Addresses**: Country-specific formats and required fields
* **Document Numbers**: Varying formats and validation rules
* **Processing Times**: Expressed in working days vs. calendar days vs. months
* **Fees**: Different currencies and inclusion/exclusion of processing fees

### Technical Variations

* **API Response Formats**: JSON vs. XML vs. CSV vs. proprietary formats
* **Error Handling**: Different error codes and resolution mechanisms
* **Update Frequency**: Real-time vs. daily vs. weekly vs. monthly refreshes
* **Data Completeness**: Varying levels of detail across systems
* **Authentication Mechanisms**: Diverse security protocols and access methods

## Standardization Framework

## Data Standardization Examples

### Example 1: Processing Time Standardization

**Raw Data:**
* US USCIS: "15 to 17 months for I-130 processing"
* Canada IRCC: "12 weeks for Family Class sponsorship"
* Australia Home Affairs: "90% of applications processed in 13 months"

**Standardization Process:**
1. Convert all time units to days
   * US: 15-17 months → 456-517 days
   * Canada: 12 weeks → 84 days
   * Australia: 13 months → 395 days

2. Normalize confidence and percentiles
   * US: Regular processing time (standard confidence)
   * Canada: Regular processing time (standard confidence)
   * Australia: 90th percentile (high confidence)

3. Create comparable record
```json
{
  "program_country": "US",
  "program_type": "family_sponsorship",
  "program_specific_id": "I-130",
  "processing_time_min_days": 456,
  "processing_time_max_days": 517,
  "processing_time_median_days": 486,
  "processing_confidence": "medium",
  "processing_percentile": "standard",
  "last_updated": "2025-05-01",
  "source": "uscis_official",
  "original_text": "15 to 17 months for I-130 processing"
}
```

### Example 2: Eligibility Criteria Standardization

**Raw Data:**
* Canada Express Entry: "Language proficiency: CLB 7"
* Australia Skilled Independent: "IELTS 6 in each component"
* UK Skilled Worker: "B1 English CEFR standard"

**Standardization Process:**
1. Map to standard language scale (using CEFR as base)
   * Canada CLB 7 → CEFR B2
   * Australia IELTS 6 → CEFR B2
   * UK B1 → CEFR B1

2. Create standardized requirement records
```json
{
  "program_country": "Canada",
  "program_name": "Express Entry - Federal Skilled Worker",
  "criterion_type": "language_proficiency",
  "criterion_category": "eligibility",
  "standardized_value": "B2",
  "original_scale": "CLB",
  "original_value": "7",
  "details": {
    "reading": "B2",
    "writing": "B2",
    "listening": "B2",
    "speaking": "B2"
  },
  "alternatives": [
    {"test": "IELTS", "value": "6.0"},
    {"test": "CELPIP", "value": "7"}
  ],
  "points_available": 24,
  "last_updated": "2025-04-15"
}
```

### Example 3: Cost Standardization

**Raw Data:**
* US: "$535 filing fee for Form I-130"
* Canada: "CAD 1,050 for sponsorship application"
* Australia: "AUD 1,300 for Partner visa application"

**Standardization Process:**
1. Identify fee components and types
2. Convert to standard currency (USD)
3. Create normalized record

```json
{
  "program_country": "US",
  "program_name": "Family Sponsorship - Immediate Relative",
  "fee_type": "application",
  "fee_subtype": "filing",
  "original_amount": 535,
  "original_currency": "USD",
  "usd_amount": 535,
  "conversion_rate": 1,
  "conversion_date": "2025-05-03",
  "includes_biometrics": false,
  "additional_fees": [
    {
      "fee_type": "biometrics",
      "usd_amount": 85,
      "conditions": "if required"
    }
  ],
  "refundable": false,
  "payment_methods": ["credit_card", "money_order", "check"],
  "last_updated": "2025-03-10"
}
```

## Best Practices for Ongoing Standardization

   * Enable tracing of transformation steps

3. **Regular Review and Updates**
   * Schedule periodic review of standardization rules
   * Update mappings when source systems change
   * Evolve the unified model as needed

4. **Performance Optimization**
   * Cache frequently accessed reference data
   * Optimize transformation algorithms
   * Use parallel processing for large data sets

5. **Transparency to End Users**
   * Provide clear indication of data sources
   * Communicate standardization methodologies
   * Offer access to original (raw) data when needed

## Conclusion

Effective standardization of immigration data is both a technical and domain expertise challenge. This guide provides a framework for creating a consistent, reliable data foundation for the Visafy platform. By implementing these standards and processes, Visafy can present unified immigration information that maintains accuracy while enabling meaningful comparisons across different countries and programs.

The standardization approach should evolve over time as new data sources are integrated and user needs become more refined. Regular review and updates to the standardization framework will ensure that Visafy continues to provide the highest quality immigration information possible.
