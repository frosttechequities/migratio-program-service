## CONCLUSION

While many countries employ formal points-based systems for skilled immigration, others use more qualitative criteria focused on qualifications, salary thresholds, and labor market needs. The most sophisticated points systems (Canada, Australia, New Zealand) typically evaluate candidates based on:

1. Age (favoring younger applicants)
2. Education (higher points for advanced degrees)
3. Language proficiency
4. Work experience (with bonus points for experience in the destination country)
5. Adaptability factors (family connections, spouse qualifications)

Even in countries without formal points systems, these same factors are often considered in determining eligibility, just with binary (yes/no) rather than graduated (point scale) assessments.
