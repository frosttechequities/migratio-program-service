## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Initial Screening
- Identify potential data sources through research and recommendations
- Check basic alignment with Visafy requirements
- Eliminate sources that fail to meet minimum criteria
- Document preliminary findings for each candidate source

### Step 2: Detailed Assessment
- Score each remaining source against all applicable criteria
- Conduct test integrations where feasible
- Interview existing users of the data source if possible
- Document full evaluation with supporting evidence

### Step 3: Comparative Analysis
- Create comparison matrix of all evaluated sources
- Identify strengths and weaknesses of each
- Map complementary sources that could work together
- Rank sources by overall suitability for Visafy needs

### Step 4: Decision and Implementation Planning
- Select primary and supplementary data sources
- Develop integration strategy for chosen sources
- Create contingency plans for source disruptions
- Establish ongoing evaluation schedule

## Data Source Types and Specific Considerations

### Government APIs

**Additional Evaluation Points:**
- Political stability and policy continuity
- Bureaucratic processes for access approval
- History of API deprecation or significant changes
- Special access for research or commercial partners

## Conclusion

This evaluation framework provides a structured, comprehensive approach to selecting and monitoring immigration data sources for the Visafy platform. By systematically assessing potential sources across multiple dimensions, Visafy can build a reliable data foundation that delivers accurate, timely, and valuable immigration information to users. The framework should be treated as a living document, updated as data requirements evolve and new sources become available.
