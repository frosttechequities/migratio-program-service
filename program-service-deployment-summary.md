# Visafy API Services Deployment - Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to prepare the Program Service for deployment to Render and provides an overview of all Visafy API services.

## GitHub Repository

The Program Service code is now available in a dedicated GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/frosttechequities/migratio-program-service](https://github.com/frosttechequities/migratio-program-service)

## Existing API Services

Visafy currently has the following API services deployed:

1. **Quiz Data API (`migratio-quiz-api`)**
   - **Purpose:** Serves quiz questions for the assessment
   - **Technology:** FastAPI, SQLite
   - **Deployed URL:** [https://migratio-quiz-api.onrender.com](https://migratio-quiz-api.onrender.com)
   - **Live API Docs:** [https://migratio-quiz-api.onrender.com/docs](https://migratio-quiz-api.onrender.com/docs)
   - **Key Endpoints:**
     - `GET /quiz/questions`: Retrieves all quiz questions
   - **Database:**
     - Type: SQLite
     - Data Source: `quiz_data_api/quiz_data.json` (loaded into `quiz_data.db` within the service)
   - **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/frosttechequities/migratio-quiz-service.git](https://github.com/frosttechequities/migratio-quiz-service.git)
   - **Deployment Platform:** Render (Free Tier)

2. **User Authentication API (`migratio-user-auth`)**
   - **Purpose:** Handles user signup, login, and token-based authentication
   - **Technology:** FastAPI, Supabase
   - **Deployed URL:** [https://migratio-user-auth.onrender.com](https://migratio-user-auth.onrender.com)
   - **Live API Docs:** [https://migratio-user-auth.onrender.com/docs](https://migratio-user-auth.onrender.com/docs)
   - **Key Endpoints:**
     - `POST /auth/signup`: Register a new user
     - `POST /auth/login`: Log in an existing user, returns access/refresh tokens
     - `GET /auth/me`: Get details for the currently authenticated user (requires Bearer token)
     - `POST /auth/logout`: Log out the current user (requires Bearer token)
   - **Supabase Configuration:**
     - Project URL: `https://xcjtfkaigogalnytjybk.supabase.co`
     - Anon Key (public): `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InhjanRma2FpZ29nYWxueXRqeWJrIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDcwMjQzMTYsImV4cCI6MjA2MjYwMDMxNn0.B5dayJJVA4wFHoCh2TyCbv7p6MDsfIv1BkDki-6ckDA`
   - **Environment Variables:**
     - `SUPABASE_URL`: https://xcjtfkaigogalnytjybk.supabase.co
     - `SUPABASE_KEY`: The Supabase anon key (public)
     - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret for JWT token generation
   - **Test User Credentials:**
     - Email: `frosttechequities@gmail.com`
     - Password: `newpassword123`
   - **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/frosttechequities/migratio-user-auth-service.git](https://github.com/frosttechequities/migratio-user-auth-service.git)
   - **Known Issue:** The logout endpoint currently returns a `500 Internal Server Error` due to an issue in the Supabase Python client library's handling of the logout response. Core auth (signup, login, /me) is unaffected.

## Conclusion

The Program Service has been successfully prepared for deployment to Render. The code is now available in a dedicated GitHub repository at [https://github.com/frosttechequities/migratio-program-service](https://github.com/frosttechequities/migratio-program-service). The changes made improve error handling, database seeding, and overall reliability of the service. The documentation provides clear instructions for deployment and troubleshooting.

With the Quiz API, User Auth API, and Program Service deployed, Visafy will have the core backend services needed to support the assessment, user management, and program recommendation features of the platform.

The deployment guide in DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md has been updated with actual details and values, making it easier for future deployments and maintenance.
