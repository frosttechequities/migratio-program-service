# Visafy API Services Deployment - Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to prepare the Program Service for deployment to Render and provides an overview of all Visafy API services.

## Existing API Services

Visafy currently has the following API services deployed:

1. **Quiz Data API (`migratio-quiz-api`)**
   - **Purpose:** Serves quiz questions for the assessment
   - **Technology:** FastAPI, MongoDB
   - **Deployed URL:** [https://migratio-quiz-api-frost.onrender.com](https://migratio-quiz-api-frost.onrender.com)
   - **Live API Docs:** [https://migratio-quiz-api-frost.onrender.com/docs](https://migratio-quiz-api-frost.onrender.com/docs)
   - **Key Endpoints:**
     - `GET /questions/`: Retrieves all quiz questions
   - **Database:**
     - Type: MongoDB
     - Data Source: Questions are loaded from the database and can be seeded using the `/seed_questions/` endpoint
   - **Environment Variables:**
     - `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING`: MongoDB connection string
     - `PORT`: Port for the FastAPI server
   - **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/frosttechequities/migratio-quiz-service.git](https://github.com/frosttechequities/migratio-quiz-service.git)

2. **User Authentication API (`migratio-user-auth`)**
   - **Purpose:** Handles user signup, login, and token-based authentication
   - **Technology:** FastAPI, Supabase
   - **Deployed URL:** [https://migratio-user-auth.onrender.com](https://migratio-user-auth.onrender.com)
   - **Live API Docs:** [https://migratio-user-auth.onrender.com/docs](https://migratio-user-auth.onrender.com/docs)
   - **Key Endpoints:**
     - `POST /auth/signup`: Register a new user
     - `POST /auth/login`: Log in an existing user, returns access/refresh tokens
     - `GET /auth/me`: Get details for the currently authenticated user (requires Bearer token)
     - `POST /auth/logout`: Log out the current user (requires Bearer token)
   - **Supabase Configuration:**
     - Project URL: `https://xcjtfkaigogalnytjybk.supabase.co`
     - Anon Key (public): `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InhjanRma2FpZ29nYWxueXRqeWJrIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDcwMjQzMTYsImV4cCI6MjA2MjYwMDMxNn0.B5dayJJVA4wFHoCh2TyCbv7p6MDsfIv1BkDki-6ckDA`
   - **Environment Variables:**
     - `SUPABASE_URL`: https://xcjtfkaigogalnytjybk.supabase.co
     - `SUPABASE_KEY`: The Supabase anon key (public)
     - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret for JWT token generation
   - **Test User Credentials:**
     - Email: `frosttechequities@gmail.com`
     - Password: `newpassword123`
   - **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/frosttechequities/migratio-user-auth-service.git](https://github.com/frosttechequities/migratio-user-auth-service.git)
   - **Known Issue:** The logout endpoint currently returns a `500 Internal Server Error` due to an issue in the Supabase Python client library's handling of the logout response. Core auth (signup, login, /me) is unaffected.

## Deployment Steps for Program Service

1. **Set Up MongoDB Atlas**
   - Create a MongoDB Atlas account
   - Create a new cluster
   - Set up database access
   - Configure network access
   - Get connection string

2. **Deploy to Render**
   - Create a new Web Service on Render
   - Choose deployment method:
